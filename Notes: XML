XML is a makrup language that dictates the transfer of data between systems
It is structured very similarly like html. In fact, there was probably some influence on html.
XML has tags like html that can have attributes that act as properties of those tags. 
XML has schemas that can pre-define the type of data and format of data sent. 
This prevents invalid formating that would confuse the parties sending data
