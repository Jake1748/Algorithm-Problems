/*  The challenge is the same thing as Two Sum, but it asks to do it without converting the integer to a string. 
    This is a solution in progress. 

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        div = 10
        nums = []
        rem = x % div

        while( rem != 0 )
            div *= 10
            nums.append( rem )
            rem = x % div


        if len(nums) == 0:
            nums.append( x )
