Given an array of distinct positive integers respesenting coin denominations and a single non-negative integer n representing a target amount of money. write a function that reutns the number f ways to make change for that target amount using the given coin denominations.

Answer:

def numberOfWaysToMakeChange(n, denoms):
    ways = [1] + [ 0 for _ in range(n) ]
    for denom in denoms:
        for way in range( denom, len(ways) ):
            ways[way] += ways[ way - denom ]
    return ways[-1]
