Prompt:
Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and inverts it. In other words, the function should swar every left node in the tree for its corresponding right node.

Answer:
function invertBinaryTree(tree) {
  if ( tree === null ) return;

  const tempBranch = tree.left;
  tree.left = tree.right;
  tree.right = tempBranch;

  invertBinaryTree( tree.left );
  invertBinaryTree( tree.right );

  return tree;
}
