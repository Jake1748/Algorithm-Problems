APIs are Application Programming Interface
It is essentially the connection point between one application, and the services of another software.
It serves as an access point where an application can reduce the amount of work it needs to do and use the services of another product.
It is a seamless workflow that connects different products and organizations.
Many APIs have free tiers, but higher usage of the API is usually met with a paywall.
