In many programming languages, arrays and strings are very similar
In fact, strings are usually modified arrays
It lends to the fact that strings are immutable and can be traversed with indexes
in python, lists are more like ArrayLists, so there are some differences 
At its core though, strings are still immutable and a proper sequence
