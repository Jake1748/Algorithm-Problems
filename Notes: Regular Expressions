Regular expressions are unique to python
They essentially are the method of isolating specific sequences in a string
Usually using the find method and looping through the handle of a document is enough for simple tasks
However, reading email and documents with specific formats presents a challenge: it doesn't follow line-by-line formatting
Regular expressions are able to sift through large pieces of data to find specific templates/formats that users want to find

In Python:
Regular expressions are imported through the re module
-search method takes a regular expression and string to return a boolean if there was a match
-findall method takes the same parameters and returns a list of the matches
